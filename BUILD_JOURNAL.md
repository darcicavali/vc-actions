# Build Journal

This file documents the evolution of vc-actions. Each work session adds an entry below.

**Rules:**
- Append-only. Never edit past entries.
- Every session, even small ones, gets an entry.
- Honest about what failed and why — that's the most valuable signal for future sessions.
- Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

## 2026-05-11 — Session 0: Spec drafted (pre-build)

### What was attempted
- v1 through v5 spec iterations with Darci
- v4 = multi-agent framework
- v5 = added memory architecture + journaling requirements

### What worked
- Star architecture (specialists → coordinator) chosen over mesh — simpler, debuggable
- Claude API as the reasoning engine per agent — flexible, calibrates over time via memory
- Three memory layers (prompts / episodic / knowledge) — covers all real cases
- Repo created, prompts uploaded as flat files via web (folder structure to be fixed at next push)

### What failed / had to retry
- v1-v3 specs were too rule-based — Darci correctly pushed for agent-driven reasoning
- v2 treated all campaign types equally — wrong; needed to focus on non-customer
- GitHub MCP couldn't auth to write to repo — Darci pushed files manually via web upload

### Decisions made
- 8 total agents (7 specialists + 1 coordinator), including FinancialAgent and SEOAgent
- Drop WhatsApp agent — data too messy
- Drop drops system from this scope (separate repo `vc-drops` for that)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 as default model
- ~$0.50/week budget acceptable

### Open questions
- Should test_mode be a per-agent flag or global? → defer to runner.py session
- How does coordinator handle a specialist that failed this week? → spec says "skip with warning"
- Should we add a `dry_run` mode that prints memos without writing? → defer

### Learnings for future sessions
- Darci wants concise responses but detailed specs — split the difference: chat short, files thorough
- Memory architecture MUST be in from day 1 — retrofitting it costs more
- Build journal entries are cheap to write and expensive to skip — never skip

## 2026-05-11 — Session 1: Cleanup + scaffold + shared infra + BaseAgent + AdsAgent

### Session goal
Per v4 + v5 specs: clean up flat-uploaded prompts, build repo scaffold, shared
infrastructure (config, claude_client, sheets_client, omnisend_client, memory,
journal, runtime_log) with tests, then BaseAgent with memory-aware `run()`,
then AdsAgent (proof-of-concept) with integration test. STOP after that for
review.

### What was attempted (cleanup phase — done)
- Moved 9 role-prompt markdown files from repo root into `prompts/`
  (ads, customer, product, content, funnel, financial, seo, coordinator,
  base_context).
- Created `.env.example` listing all required env vars per v4 §"Manual setup."
- Created `.gitignore` (Python + secrets + tooling).
- No `download` file present, nothing to delete.
- Created empty directory skeleton: `agents/ scripts/ tests/ tests/fixtures/
  .github/workflows/`.

### What was attempted (build phase)
- `scripts/config.py` — dataclass-based, `lru_cache`'d `get_config()`, env-driven.
- `scripts/claude_client.py` — wraps `anthropic.Anthropic`, returns
  `ClaudeResponse(text, input_tokens, output_tokens, model)` so the runtime
  log can capture cost without re-parsing. Strips ```json fences.
- `scripts/sheets_client.py` — gspread-based, centralizes all I/O: tab
  bootstrap with `TAB_SCHEMAS`, memo append/read, lessons read (active +
  scoped + non-expired), outcomes read, runtime log append. Retry on
  `APIError` with exponential backoff.
- `scripts/memory.py` — `load_agent_memory()` + `render_memory_block()`
  produce the deterministic, model-friendly memory text block. Best-effort:
  missing tabs degrade to empty lists.
- `scripts/runtime_log.py` — `RuntimeEntry` dataclass + writer.
- `scripts/journal.py` — `JournalEntry` + `append_entry()` for this very
  journal. Future runtime tooling can use the same writer.
- `scripts/omnisend_client.py` — minimal POST-event client for the digest.
- `agents/base.py` — `BaseAgent` with memory-aware `run()` per v5 §Part 2:
  loads lessons + own memos + outcomes, builds prompt, calls Claude,
  parses JSON, writes memo, ALWAYS writes a runtime log row (ok or error).
- `agents/ads_agent.py` — proof-of-concept specialist: reads the 5 Meta Ads
  tabs, missing tabs degrade to error placeholders in the data block.
- Tests: 34 passing. Real prompts + role file + base_context.md exercised
  in `tests/test_ads_agent.py`. Lesson-honoring, memory-empty, and error-path
  cases are all covered.

### What worked
- Hand-rolled `FakeSpreadsheet`/`FakeWorksheet` fixtures over mocking — the
  tests are behaviorally honest and read like the production code.
- `try/finally` in `BaseAgent.run()` guarantees a Runtime Log row even when
  Claude or sheets writes raise. Inner `try` on the log write itself prevents
  logging failures from masking the real exception.
- `MemoRow`/`LessonRow`/`OutcomeRow` dataclasses give us typed access at the
  consumer side without adding Pydantic.
- Centralizing tab schemas in `TAB_SCHEMAS` lets us `ensure_all_tabs()` for
  bootstrap and re-validate headers if they drift.

### What failed / had to retry
- System-installed `cryptography==41.0.7` panicked at import time
  (`pyo3_runtime.PanicException`) because gspread's auth pulls
  `google-auth` → `cryptography`. Fix: `pip install --force-reinstall
  --ignore-installed cryptography`. Not a code bug, but worth recording for
  any future environment that hits the same Rust ABI mismatch.
- Initial `FakeWorksheet.update` only supported `A1` updates. That's enough
  for ensure_tab; if a future test needs arbitrary-cell writes the fake will
  need extending.

### Decisions made
- **Dataclasses over Pydantic** to match vc-drops style and keep deps minimal.
- **Sequential runs, no async** — 7 agents × ~30s each is fine, and async
  would complicate error isolation per the v4 try/except-per-agent rule.
- **Memory failures degrade to empty lists** rather than aborting the run.
  Acceptance criteria require the empty-memory case to work; same code path
  also covers a transiently flaky sheets read.
- **Claude response cost computed client-side** from a small price table.
  Avoids needing the API's metadata endpoint; price drift will require a
  manual update but cost is tiny.
- **Raw response truncated to 8KB** before writing to the sheet, per v5
  schema. Full response is still on the in-memory `AgentMemo`.
- **`run()` always writes a runtime log row**, even on failure. Status
  column is the distinguishing field.

### Open questions
- `dry_run` mode is in `Config` but not yet honored — defer to the
  `runner.py` session.
- Should `BaseAgent.run()` swallow lesson-loading exceptions and still emit
  a memo, or hard-fail? Currently it hard-fails on `gather_data` errors and
  swallows memory-tab errors. Likely fine; revisit when running live.
- Meta Ads tab names (`Meta Ads Summary` etc.) are assumed from spec — need
  Darci to confirm exact tab names in the dashboard sheet before live run.

### Learnings for future sessions
- The fake-gspread fixture pattern in `tests/conftest.py` is reusable for
  every future specialist agent — keep it generic, do not add agent-specific
  helpers there.
- Use `prompts_dir=...` constructor arg on BaseAgent so tests can point to
  any directory; the default is `scripts/config.PROMPTS_DIR`.
- When wiring the runner, route per-agent `try/except` AROUND `run()`, not
  inside it — coordinator should still see partial state.
- 34 tests, ~0.3s — keep test suite fast and add to it per agent. Don't
  introduce live-network tests in this repo.

## 2026-05-11 — Session 2: Remaining specialists + GoalsAgent + runner

### Session goal
After Session 1 was approved, build the other 6 specialist agents
(CustomerAgent, ProductAgent, ContentAgent, FunnelAgent, FinancialAgent,
SEOAgent), then the GoalsAgent coordinator, the runner that orchestrates
the weekly run, the GitHub Actions workflow, and a dry-run mode the user
asked for.

### What was attempted
- Added `dry_run` mode to `BaseAgent` (printable preview, no sheet writes,
  no Runtime Log write). Surfaced as `--dry-run` CLI flag on the runner
  and `VC_ACTIONS_DRY_RUN` env var.
- Extracted shared specialist boilerplate into `BaseAgent.data_tabs` +
  default `gather_data()`. Each specialist is now a ~15-line file that
  declares `name`, `role_prompt_file`, `data_tabs`.
- Built `CustomerAgent`, `ProductAgent`, `ContentAgent`, `FunnelAgent`,
  `FinancialAgent`, `SEOAgent` using that pattern.
- Added a parametrized test (`tests/test_specialists.py`) that runs every
  specialist class through a full `run()` and verifies the prompt file
  exists, tabs land in the prompt, and a memo + Runtime Log row are
  written.
- Built `GoalsAgent` (coordinator). It overrides `gather_data` to read
  this-run specialist memos + Goal Tracker + Weekly Summary; overrides
  `build_prompt` to use the coordinator schema; overrides `parse_response`
  to produce both an `AgentMemo` (for the memory layer to find next week)
  AND an `ActionPlan` dataclass; overrides `write_memo` to append to
  `Agent Memos` and OVERWRITE the `Action Plan` tab.
- Added `SheetsClient.write_action_plan(...)` and tightened
  `FakeWorksheet.update` to handle multi-row replacements.
- Built `scripts/runner.py` with 3 phases: specialists (failure-isolated
  per agent) → coordinator → Omnisend digest email (skipped if not
  configured or in dry-run). CLI entrypoint: `python -m scripts.runner
  [--dry-run]`.
- Added `.github/workflows/weekly_run.yml` — Monday 13:00 UTC cron + a
  manual-trigger button with a dry-run input + a separate test job.
- Tests: 57 passing, ~0.3s. Includes runner happy-path, runner with one
  injected specialist failure (coordinator still runs), and runner
  dry-run (zero sheet writes anywhere).

### What worked
- The single `data_tabs` declaration kept each new specialist tiny.
  Adding agents is now near-free.
- Routing GoalsAgent output through BOTH `Agent Memos` AND `Action Plan`
  means the memory layer "just works" for the coordinator next week —
  no custom loader needed.
- The runner's failure isolation is per-agent `try/except` AROUND `run()`,
  not inside it. Specialists still get their own Runtime Log row on
  failure (BaseAgent's `try/finally` handles that).
- The stub Claude in `tests/test_runner.py` distinguishes specialist vs.
  coordinator prompts by looking for `"sequenced_actions"` in the prompt
  text. Simple and robust without parsing JSON.

### What failed / had to retry
- `FakeWorksheet.update` originally only handled single-row A1 writes
  (sufficient for `ensure_tab`). The Action Plan overwrite is two rows
  (headers + data), so it had to be generalized to replace the whole row
  range. That broke nothing else.
- Initial `test_action_plan_is_overwritten_not_appended` ran without
  prior memos and the coordinator returned 0 memos. Fixed by seeding
  specialist memos via `_seed_specialist_memos` before each run.
- The injected-failure test originally used agent class names as needles
  to detect which prompt to fail. That was unreliable (the class name
  isn't in the prompt). Switched to a fragment of the role prompt
  (`"CRM & Lifecycle Specialist"` — the heading of customer.md).

### Decisions made
- **Dry-run is per-instance with config fallback.** Each agent accepts
  `dry_run=...` in `__init__`; if not passed, falls back to
  `config.dry_run`. This lets the runner force dry-run via CLI while
  still respecting env config.
- **Coordinator writes to BOTH tabs.** `Action Plan` is the structured,
  weekly-overwritten plan; `Agent Memos` gets a coordinator entry so the
  memory layer sees its own history.
- **Action Plan tab is fully overwritten on each write** (header row +
  one data row). Matches v4 spec "overwritten weekly."
- **Runner returns non-zero exit code if any specialist failed.**
  Coordinator failures alone also count. Lets GitHub Actions surface
  red runs.
- **Workflow cron at 13:00 UTC.** That's 8 AM CDT (DST) / 7 AM CST.
  Better than getting 9 AM during DST shoulder. Can be adjusted if Darci
  prefers exactly 8 AM CST.
- **Specialists use the natural tab names from v4 spec verbatim.** User
  confirmed Meta Ads tab names match; the others are best-guess until
  verified against the live `vc-dashboard` sheet. Missing tabs degrade
  to error placeholders, so a mismatch won't crash a run — it'll just
  show up in `data_quality` from Claude.

### Open questions
- Tab name verification for the non-Meta specialists. Best done by
  running `--dry-run` against the real sheet and seeing which tabs come
  back as `{"error": "WorksheetNotFound"}` in the data block.
- Goal Tracker auto-population — spec says it's manually maintained by
  Darci. No bootstrap rows beyond headers. Confirm before first live
  run.
- The Omnisend automation must be created MANUALLY by Darci. The runner
  just triggers an event named `vc_weekly_plan` (configurable); Omnisend
  has to be configured to listen and render the email body from the
  event properties.

### Learnings for future sessions
- A 15-line specialist file is the right size. Don't add logic to them —
  if data needs munging, do it in `BaseAgent` or a helper.
- The "Coordinator memo also lives in Agent Memos" choice pays for
  itself in week 2 — no special-case code in the memory layer.
- For workflow YAML, prefer `vars` for non-secret config (model name,
  recipient email) and `secrets` only for credentials. Easier rotation.
